User script for GreaseMonkey that renders LaTeX expressions no matter where they appear in the browser. Useful for use with llama.cpp server and other LLM interfaces that don't support LaTeX rendering natively.

# Installation

Install a user script extension such as GreaseMonkey or ViolentMonkey.

Then create a new script in the extension, copy the contents of main.js into it and save it.

Edit the script headers to change what pages it should be active on.

That's all.

Note: This script has been tested on Firefox and Chrome.
